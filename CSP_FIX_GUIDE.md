# 🔒 Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix for EmailJS

## ❌ Problem Encountered
```
Fetch API cannot load https://api.emailjs.com/api/v1.0/email/send. 
Refused to connect because it violates the document's Content Security Policy.
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
Added `https://api.emailjs.com` to the CSP `connect-src` directive in `index.html`.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What is CSP?
Content Security Policy is a security feature that prevents malicious scripts from making unauthorized network requests.

### Why EmailJS was Blocked?
The CSP policy didn't include `api.emailjs.com` in the allowed domains for network connections.

### Fix Applied
**Before:**
```html
connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co ... https://*.vercel.app;
```

**After:**
```html
connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co ... https://*.vercel.app https://api.emailjs.com;
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### 1. Check Browser Console
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Try admin login with authorized email
- Should see: `"Sending OTP to email..."` instead of CSP errors

### 2. Network Tab Verification
- Open Developer Tools → Network tab
- Try sending OTP
- Look for successful POST request to `api.emailjs.com`
- Status should be 200 (success)

### 3. Email Delivery Test
- Enter authorized email: `saythu000@gmail.com`
- Click "Send OTP"
- Check email inbox (and spam folder)
- Should receive actual OTP email

## 🚨 Common CSP Issues

### If Still Getting CSP Errors:
1. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check for typos** - Ensure `https://api.emailjs.com` is correct
3. **Verify CSP syntax** - No missing semicolons or spaces
4. **Test in incognito mode** - Eliminates extension conflicts

### Alternative CSP Configurations:
If the fix doesn't work, try these alternatives:

**Option 1: More Permissive (Development)**
```html
connect-src 'self' https: http:;
```

**Option 2: EmailJS Specific (Production)**
```html
connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.emailjs.com;
```

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix:
- ❌ CSP error in console
- ❌ EmailJS API blocked
- ❌ No email sent
- ❌ "Email Delivery Failed" message

### After Fix:
- ✅ No CSP errors
- ✅ EmailJS API calls successful
- ✅ Real OTP emails sent
- ✅ "OTP Sent Successfully!" message

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### 1. Console Logs
Look for these messages:
```
✅ "EmailJS initialized with service: service_xxx"
✅ "Sending OTP to email@example.com..."
✅ "Email sent successfully: {status: 200}"
```

### 2. Error Messages
If you see these, CSP fix didn't work:
```
❌ "Refused to connect because it violates CSP"
❌ "Failed to fetch"
❌ "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
```

### 3. Network Requests
Check Network tab for:
- ✅ POST request to `api.emailjs.com`
- ✅ Status: 200 OK
- ✅ Response: `{"status": 200}`

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### For Hostinger:
The CSP fix in `index.html` will work automatically when deployed.

### For Other Hosts:
Some hosts may override CSP headers. If emails still don't work:
1. Check host-specific CSP settings
2. Add EmailJS domain in hosting control panel
3. Contact hosting support for CSP configuration

## ✅ Verification Checklist
- [ ] CSP updated in `index.html`
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] No CSP errors in browser console
- [ ] EmailJS API calls successful
- [ ] Real OTP emails received
- [ ] Admin login works end-to-end
